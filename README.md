The final version is currently on master branch

To run our game:
1. Go to the CSE125_EXE folder and we have our client executable as a file CSE125Console.exe and our server as BattleBlocksServer4.exe.

2. To connect to the server, enter the IP Address on the client side while the server is running. 
To figure out the server IP Address, go to start menu and type in cmd, then ipconfig.

3. Now, once you have 4 players connect to the server, enjoy the robot fighting!
